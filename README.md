# Global Causes of Death Analysis (1990-2019)

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a group effort by Eng. Nour Emil, Eng. Omar Elbadry, and myself. Our objective was to analyze the global trends in causes of death over three decades (1990-2019) across 204 countries, with over 1 billion recorded deaths. Using Python, Excel, and Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the data, discover trends, and visualize key insights for a better understanding of mortality patterns and their contributing factors.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to offer insights into the leading causes of death worldwide and highlight how these trends vary across countries and regions. Our analysis focuses on identifying the top causes of death, exploring correlations between various diseases, and presenting this information in an easy-to-use, dynamic dashboard.

### Key Points of Analysis:
- **Countries Analyzed**: 204
- **Total Deaths Recorded**: Over 1 billion
- **Average Deaths per Country**: 7,740
- **Time Frame**: 1990-2019
- **Focus Areas**: Top causes of death, disease correlations, and regional trends.

## Methodology

### 1. **Python**:
We used Python for data loading, cleaning, and visualization:
- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Addressing missing values and ensuring proper data formatting.
- **Visualizations**: Line charts and heatmaps to analyze correlations between causes of death.
- **Predictive Model**: Built a simple model to forecast future trends using historical data.

### 2. **Excel**:
Excel was used to create interactive tools:
- **Pivot Tables**: Summarized data by country, cause, and year.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Death trends visualized across time and countries.
- **Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard for selecting countries and viewing trends over time.

### 3. **Power BI**:
Power BI was used for an interactive dashboard:
- **Power Query**: Transformed the data for easy analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Various charts and slicers to explore death trends.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Global Death Trends**
- Global deaths ranged from 45 to 55 million annually from 1990 to 2019.
- Cardiovascular diseases remained the leading cause of death, followed by cancers and respiratory diseases.

### 2. **Top Countries by Total Deaths (1990-2019)**
- **China**: 265 million deaths
- **India**: 238 million deaths
- **United States**: 71 million deaths
- **Russia**: 59 million deaths
- **Indonesia**: 44 million deaths

### 3. **Key Analytical Questions**
- How have global deaths changed annually from 1990 to 2019?
- What are the top countries by total deaths?
- Which countries have the highest death rates for diseases like Alzheimer's and HIV/AIDS?
- What is the correlation between diabetes and cardiovascular diseases?

### 4. **Leading Causes of Death**
- Cardiovascular Diseases
- Neoplasms
- Chronic Respiratory Diseases
- Lower Respiratory Infections
- Neonatal Disorders

### 5. **Comparative Insights**
- High correlation between diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
- Developing countries show higher rates of neonatal disorders and nutritional deficiencies.

## Dashboard Insights
- **Population Impact**: Larger countries like China and India have higher death counts.
- **Developing vs. Developed Nations**: NCDs are the primary causes of death in developed nations.
- **Infant Mortality**: Neonatal disorders are prevalent in regions with poor healthcare.
- **Environmental Factors**: Respiratory diseases suggest environmental influences.

## Conclusion
- Developed nations face high death rates from chronic diseases, while developing nations struggle with neonatal disorders and infectious diseases.
- As populations age, global death rates will rise, emphasizing the need for healthcare improvements.

## Future Considerations
- Aging populations will drive up mortality from cardiovascular diseases and cancers.
- Developing healthcare systems to manage NCDs and environmental health factors will reduce death rates.
- Further analysis should focus on per capita death rates for accurate country comparisons.
